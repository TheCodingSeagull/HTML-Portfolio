<p>Dear Reader, <br />
You will find the list of my favourite movies of all time below. <br />
Kindly note that these were all rated according to my personal preferences and should in no way be taken seriously. <br />
These will be categorized following their genre along with a short description of why I though the movie was brilliant. </p>

<h3>Horror movies</h3>
<h4>- Happy Death Day (Comedy/Slasher)</h4>
<p>What happens when you relive the day of your death over and over again? You get a chance to solve your own murder and make friends along the way. 
The concept alone is something I really enjoyed about this comedy-horror flick. But what makes it really worth it is the intense character devevloppment and realistic interractions!! <br /></p>
<br />
<p>You start with this mean girl living her best sorority life, bullying people with her fake friends and once she gets killed and thinks herself to be in purgatory, 
she really manages to change and become this badass fighting the murderer to protect the ones she loves and to stay by them another day!!</p>
<br />
<h5>Honorable mentions include: Scream, Meghan, Chucky, Hush </h5>

<h4>- Train to Busan (Zombies)</h4>
<p>A man takes his estranged little daughter to her grandparent's house when the zombie apocalypse begins! 
In the chaos that erupts he finds himself on a train heading to Busan surrounded by people and zombies! And in typical
zombie flick fashion, it's not just the zombies they have to look out for. <br /></p>
<br />
<p>Once again, I think the fort√© of this film is the bond between the characters, making the dad go from a cold and detached business man to a devoted father that would shield his little girl from any zombie.
But don't get me wrong!! Everything else is equally as perfect!! The zombies are fasttt, making the action scenes intense! The cinematography? <br />
<br /></p>
<p>It's perfection incarnate, the producers make you feel as if you were on the train, having you constantly on the edge of your seat, desperate to keep your eyes peeled for more!</p>
<h5>Honorable mentions include: REC, The Girl with all the gifts, Shaun of the Dead (Comedy/Zombie)
</h5>

<h4>- Silence of the lambs (Psychological/Thriller)</h4>
What do you get when you ask an FBI trainee to interview a highly intelligent serial killer & former forensic psychiatrist to help catch a murderer? <br />
<br />You get gaslighted, and put in lots of danger and lots and lots of death!! <br />
<br />
And if that alone isn't enough to convince you to watch this highly dealdy and exciting game of 4D chess then trust me when I tell you that Anthony Hopkins (who plays Dr.Lecter) won a fricking OSCAR for his amazing 16 minutes performance!!
Honestly..need I say more? Drop everything and.go.watch.thisss!! 
<h5>Honorable mentions include: Split, Psycho, Don't Breathe</h5>
<h4>-A quiet place (Creature)</h4>
Imagine living in a post-apocalyptic world in which there is not a sound to be heard. Are there people? Sure--But they're just walking on eggshells (or rather sand paths) to not get devoured by sound-detecting hell creatures!!! <br />
<br />
No but seriously? The atomsphere of this entire movie is CHILLING!! Like at times--you even find yourself holding your breath because of how immersive this film is!! <br />
<br />
Oh and the best part of this unique experience of a film? There is no sound-track, making the entire ordeal an exhilerating but nerve-wracking show making you pray for everyone's survival!!
<br />
Simply AMAZING!!!
<h5>Honorable mentions include: Alien, Birdbox, Get Out </h5>
<h4>-The Conjuring (Supernatural)</h4>
What could go wrong when a big white family invests all of their money into an abandoned centuries old home and move in? <br />
Why you eventually encounter some demon bois and get severely haunted and possesed! ...Which is exactly what happens to the Perron family! <br />
<br /> 
Once the spirits torment the family enough, going so far as to yeet a child through a glass door, they decide to get help from the Warrens (aka ghost hunters), <br />
Who then proceed to severly document, get almost possesed/murdered/haunted by the spirit of an evil witch-bitch. <br />
<br />
With amazing effects, naturally-paced storytelling and great performances by the entire cast, I 100% recommend you watch this!! It makes for a great horror movie (that in fact started a franchise) <br /> 
...and gives you the incredible life lesson of not messing with spirits or old homes.
<h5>Honorable mentions include: The Exorcist, The Nun, IT, Talk to Me (Don't watch if you're alone & can't take Gore) </h5>
<h3>Action movies </h3>
<h4>-V for Vendetta (Action/Drama)</h4>
<p> This film is based off of Alan Moore's comic by the same name. But trust me, this movie is wayy more badass!!<br />
The character of V? Has amazing lines, great humor and is one badass vigilante; fighting the tyranny of a distopian Big Brother version of London!!
If you watch this then you're in for one hell of a ride with epic explosions scenes, blades clashing but also mixed with a bit of romance and homicide.
I mean, what's not to love?!! <br />
Plus the cast has amazing chemistry!! Did I mention that V cooked eggs for Evey? :D  </p>
<h5>Honorable Mentions: The Terminator, Rush Hour, Guardians of the Galaxy, Indiana Jones, John Wick</h5>
<h3>Wholesome / Thought-provoking movies</h3>
<h4>-The Green Book (Drama/Comedy)</h4>
<p>Picture this: A roadtrip with a racist Italian-American driver and a wealthy black passanger. <br />
The two seem to have nothing in common at first, with incredibly tense interactions...but with enough time and conversation they become really close...<br />
Navigating a world that wants to challenge their friendship and endanger their lives at every turn.<br />
Honestly, it's truly a wholesome watch: with great character developpment, true-story storytelling and powerful musical score and the film really makes you feel the humanity and question: <br />
"Why on earth does racism still exist??" </p>

<h5>Honorable mentions include: Ghost, Titanic, Gravity</h5>
<h3>Animated Movies</h3>
<h4>-Zootopia</h4>
<p>If you love animals, and a good action/mystery movie, then this movie is defintely for you!! <br />
With amazing action scenes, deep emotional ties & chemistry between the character but above all: Subpar writing and world building, <br />
I'd def recommend this to anyone!!  </p>
